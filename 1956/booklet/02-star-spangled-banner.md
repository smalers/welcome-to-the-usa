# A Welcome to USA "Citizenship" / The Star-Spangled Banner #

*The Star-Spangled Banner*

Oh say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,  
What so proudly we hail'd at the twiligh's last gleaming?  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,  
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.  
Oh say, does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave  
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silense reposes,  
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,  
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:  
'Tis the Star-Spangled Banner! O, long may it wave  
O're the land of the free and the home of the brave!

O this be it ever, when freeman shall stand  
Between their lov'd home and the war's desolation;  
Blest with vic'try and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land  
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us a Nation!  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust!"  
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave  
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Written by Francis Scott Key, Baltimore lawyer, in 1814 during the
bombardment of Fort McHenry.  Adopted by Congress as the national
anthem in 1931.  The flag referred to is preserved in the National
Museum, Washington, D. C.
