Dear Fellow Citizen:

It is, indeed, a pleasure to greet you as a new
citizen of the United States of America and to congratulate
you upon this most important occasion.

In attaining United States citizenship you have gained
a priceless possession.  Its ideals reflect the hopes and
aspirations of liberty-loving people down through the
centuries.

You have joined a vast multitude of free people and
now share with them the opportunity to help preserve and
carry out the principles of freedome and justice.

Herbert Brownell, Jr.
Attorney General
