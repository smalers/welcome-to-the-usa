# A Welcome to USA "Citizenship" / American's Creed #

*American's Creed*

I believe in the United States of America as a Government
of the People, by the People, for the People, whose just powers
are derived from the consent of the governed; a democracy in
a republic; a sovereign nation of many sovereign states; a
perfect union, one and inseparable, established upon those
principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which
American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes. I therefore
believe it my duty to my country to love it, to support its
Constitution, to obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend
it against all enemies.
