*The Meaning of American Citizenship*

J. M. Swing

*Commissioner of Immigation and Naturalization*

Today you have become a citizen of the United States of
America.  You are no longer an Englishman, a Frenchman,
an Italian, a Pole.  Neither are you a hyphenated-American --
a Polish-American, an Italian-American.  You are no
longer a subject of a government. Henceforth, you are an
integral part of this Government -- a freeman -- a Citizen of
the United States of America.

This citizenship, which as been solemnly conferred on you,
is a thing of the spirit -- not of the flesh.  WHen you took the
oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States you
claimed for yourself the God-given unalianable rights which
that sacred document sets fort as the natural right of all
men.

You have made sacrifices to reach this desired goal.  We,
your fellow citizens, realize this, and the warmth of our welcome
to you is increased proportionately.  However, we would
tincture it with friendly caution.

As you have learned during these years of preparation, this
great honor carries with it the duty to work for and make secure
this longed for and eagerly sought status.  Government
under our Constitution makes American citizenship the highest
privilege nd at the same time the greatest responsibility
of any citezenship in the world.

The important rights that are now yours and the duties and
responsibilities attendant thereon are set forth elsewhere in
this souvenir booklet.  It is hoped that they will serve as a
constant reminder that only by continuing to study and learn
about your new Country, its ideals, achievements, and goals,
and by everlastingly working at your citizenship can you enjoy
its fruits and assure their preservation for generations to
follow.

May you find in this Nation the fulfillment of your dreams
of peace and security, and may America, in turn, never find
you wanting in your new and proud role of Citizen of the
United States.
