*The Duties of a Citizen*

It is my duty to obey my country's laws.

It is my duty to vote, so my government may truly represent the
will of the people.

It is my duty to keep informed as to the honesty and ability of
candidates for public office.

It is my duty, by my votes and my influence, to correct injustice.

It is my duty to pay such taxes as have been devised by my representatives
delected by me, to defray the cost of government.

It is my duty to serve on jury when called on.

It may sometimes become my duty to hold a public office for
which I am suited, so my government may function efficiently.

It is my duty to defend my country, if need should arise.

It is my duty to abide by the will of the majority, to stand behind
my government, so my nation may be unified in time of crisis.
