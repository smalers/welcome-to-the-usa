**Rights and Privileges of a Citizen**

I may think as I please.

I may speak or write as I please, so long as I do not interfere with the rights of others.

I have hte right to vote.  By my vote I choose the public officers
who are really my servants.

I have the right to choose my work, to seek any job for which
my experience and ability have fitted me.

I have the right to try to improve my lot through various means.

I have the right to a prompt trial by jury, if I should be accused
of a crime.

I may seek justice in the courts where I have equal rights with
others.

I have the privelege of sharing in the benefits of many of the
natural resources of my country.

I may educate my children in free schools.

I have the right to worship ans I think best.

I have the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
