**Oath of Allegiance**

I HEREBY declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely
renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to my foreign
prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I
have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support
and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of
America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will
bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear
arms on behalf of the United States when required by law;(1)
or that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed
forces of the United States when required by law;(1) or that
I will perform work of national importance under civilian
