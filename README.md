## Introduction ##

This repository contains digital content for the "A Welcome to USA Citizenship" booklet
that was provided to people becoming naturalized citizens.
The initial content is from the 1956 revision.

The plan is to provide markdown (text) versions that can be easily copied and pasted into other content,
as well as scanned images of the pages.

As time allows, an attempt will be made to find referenced materials and perhaps versions from other years.

The work to digitize the documents began March 1, 2025.
Perhaps what was written in 1956 provides useful insigut for today.

The organization and format of this material may change over time.

There is currently no license.
The original version was published by the Federal Government and is therefore public domain.
The end page says "U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 1956  O--381479".
